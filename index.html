					<p>Built an algorithm that scrapped data from the website <a href="https://www.ooyyo.com/spain" target="_blank">Ooyyo</a>, developed an algorithm to predict the price of a car (mean error of 17%), and conducted a small study to identify trends.</p>

                        <p><b>This project had 3 phases:</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li> · Scrapping off the data</li>
							<li> · Finding out any trends</li>
							<li> · Building a predictive model with xgboost</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<p><b>Scrapping off the data</b><br>
						The scrapped website was composed of a pages with 7 to 9 cars each one. <br>
						The publication of each car on the list did not have the whole information in it, <br>
						so I had to parse through the html code to get the url of the page of each specific car. <br>
						The information of each car was loaded through a javascript, so normal http requests wouldnt work, <br>
						selenium allowed me to load the javascript(python library) and then grab the information. <br>
						<br>
						After processing all the loaded cars, I had to progress to the next page. <br>
						At the bottom of the page there was a button that led you to the next page, this button had an url, I just had to get it and then repeat the process. <br>
						<br>
						After repeating this process a couple of hundred of times, I saved all the information on a csv file using pandas. <br>
						These were the values that would be saved: <br>
						<b>Brand, car_price, price_rating, model, trim, km, fuel_type, body_type, color, power, transmissions</b>

						<b>Finding out any kind of trend</b><br>
						
						
						<b>Trend 1:</b><br>
						<br>
						<b>Introduction:</b><br>
						<br>
						Supposing that a superior price rating should correspond to a more economical purchase relative to a car's intrinsic value, we endeavour to discern prevailing trends among various price ratings.<br>
						<br>
						
						<img src="Images\car_price_price_rating.png" alt="Description of the image" width="900"><br>

						
						<b> Trend:</b><br>
						<br>
						Evidenced by the graphical representation, higher-priced cars exhibit a tendency for superior price ratings.<br>
						<br>
						Cause:<br>
						<br>
						This phenomenon may stem from the diminishing perceptibility of a price differential as costs escalate, particularly in contrast to lower-priced alternatives.<br>
						<br>
						Rationale:<br>
						<br>
						We acknowledge that heightened price ratings correlate with greater percentage savings and often denote superior quality in comparison to more budget-friendly alternatives. Consequently, we infer that vehicles with elevated price ratings signify substantial cost savings.<br>
						<br>
						Potential Exploitation:<br>
						<br>
						By following a logical extrapolation, we posit that vendors are more likely to entertain reduced offers for higher-priced vehicles.<br>
						<br>
						Trend 2:<br>
						<br>
						Introduction:<br>
						<br>
						The decision to sell a vehicle typically arises from mechanical issues, wear and tear, or simply a desire for a newer model, despite the vehicle's operational functionality.<br>
						<br>
						
						<img src="Images\mi_make.png" alt="Description of the image" width="900"><br>
						
						Trend:<br>
						<br>
						On average, vehicles from certain brands are sold with higher mileage. This tendency may indicate either superior durability inherent to vehicles from those brands or could be attributed to socioeconomic factors, where owners opt to maximize their vehicle's utility until it is no longer viable.<br>
						<br>
						Furthermore, the higher price point associated with these brands may incentivize owners to prolong vehicle use, thus contributing to the higher average mileage.<br>
						<br>
						
						<img src="Images\car_price_make.png" alt="Description of the image" width="900"><br>
						
						<br>
						We observe a confluence of high-scoring brands across both graphs, indicating a consistent pattern whereby certain brands produce more durable vehicles, likely attributable to their higher price points.<br>

						
						
						
						<br>
						<b>Building a predictive model with xgboost</b> <br>
						This part has 3 steps:<br>
						 · Cleaning the Data<br>
						 · Encoding the Data<br>
						 · Traning the model<br>
						 
						 Cleaning the data was easy, I just had to check for any missing values.<br>
						 After that I just had to check for any input that wasnt within its category<br>
						 Ex: Peugot in the kilometers column.<br>
						 There still were quite a few problems, some columns that represented numbers had characters mixed inside of them.<br>
						 I just used some string alteration functions to solve that.<br>
						 Ex: "1 EU" -> 1<br><br>
						 
						 Encoding the data was the trickier part, this is done to make it much easier for the machine to learn.<br>
						 Resulting on a better predictive model.<br><br>
						 
						 Firstly, I had to decide which columns would be encoded, then which kind of encoding for which.<br>
						 At the end I decided to use one-hotspot encoding for all columns except for the price rating, I used a normal encoding for that one.<br><br>
						 
						 At last, I just had to train the program. I ran the data scrapper algorythm 500 times, resulting on 7500 rows of data.<br>
						 Then it was divided between a training dataset(4500 rows) and a testing dataset(3000 rows).<br>
						 After that I just inputed the two datasets and trained it.<br><br>
						 
						 
						 <b>Small note on how does the XGBOOST machine learning model works:</b><br>
						 This model trains a random forest, then it testes the random forest with the test values.<br>
						 After that it fixes the parts that caused the most errors.<br>
						 It repeats this process until there is no further improvement.<br><br>
						 <b>Another small note:</b><br>
						 I just realized that I could had made a model for each one of the brands.<br>
						 Which would had resulted on much more accurate results, but it is already finished.<br>
